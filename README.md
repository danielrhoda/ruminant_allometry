# ruminant_allometry

This is the code associated with a manuscript [eventual link] on craniofacial evolutionary allometry in Ruminantia, asking how constraints on variation at the species level scales to explain macroevolutionary patterns.

'ruminant_functions' - the custom scripts needed to run analyses and plot data

'processing_data' - code to clean and wrangle the raw landmark data into formats suitable for anlaysis

'analysis_figures' - all the code needed to replicate the analyses and figures presented in this manuscript


First, run 'ruminant_functions', which will load all the packages and define all the functions needed. Then, load "ruminant_data.Rdata" and run "analysis_figures" to reproduce all the parts of the figures included in the manuscript (and more!). If you'd like to see how I processed Haber's 2016 raw dataset, etc, see the 'processing_data' script.
