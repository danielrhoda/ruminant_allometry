# ruminant_allometry

This is the code associated with a manuscript in preparation on craniofacial evolutionary allometry in Ruminantia, asking how constraints on variation at the species level scales to explain macroevolutionary patterns.

'ruminant_functions' - the custom scripts needed to run analyses and plot data

'processing_data' - code to clean and wrangle the raw landmark data into formats suitable for anlaysis

'analysis_figures' - all the code needed to replicate the analyses and figures presented in this manuscript


'figures_results' - older version of 'analysis_figures'
